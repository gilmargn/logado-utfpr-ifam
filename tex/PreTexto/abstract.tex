In software development, it is common to use metrics to assess the quality of code and the time spent producing it. In Education is not default, however, this project will help to obtain new informations to recognize standard and metrics. This work proposes the creation of a \textit{dataset} with records (logs) of the code development process, capturing the learning trail in real time. Unlike conventional approaches, which rely on Learning Management Systems, the collection will be carried out using a \textit{plugin} integrated with a widely used code editor, aimed at both programming and documentation. The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed database for future analyses, contributing to the study of programming teaching and learning.
